# a. Make a list of characters in the novel. You need to decide whom to include. 

# b. Extract a social graph of the manually identified characters in the text 
# To do this, you need to use a co-occurrence algorithm
# Also, plot the graph using networkx

# Calculate the four types of centrality of main protagonists i.e. degree,
betweenness, closeness, PageRank . (Ref : Unit 1 – centrality analysis)

# Calculate the global clustering coefficient of your graph and local clustering
coefficient of the main protagonist nodes. (Ref : Unit 2 – Measures of cohesion)
e. Detect communities using the following methods: 

i. K - clique (percolation method)
ii. Louvain community detection
iii. Girvann Newman

# Find the degree distribution, average shortest path, and size of the largest
component. Also create equivalent generative models to compare against the
social graph that you extracted 

i. G(n,p) and G(n,m) generated graph
ii. Preferential attachment
iii. Small-world model
